# Cybersecurity in Healthcare

The healthcare industry is experiencing a rapid increase in the adoption of digital technologies, including electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, and wearable devices. While these technologies have the potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes, they also pose a significant threat to patient privacy and security. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile data breaches in the healthcare sector, resulting in the theft of sensitive patient information. The risk of cyberattacks and data breaches has become an increasingly significant concern for healthcare organizations, governments, and patients alike.
